## Introduction

This post credits Maria Doyle (Bioconductor Community Manager) for finding [WAVE][wave-website] (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools),
a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities.

This post also promotes the regular usage of any accessibility evaluation tool while contributing to this website.

## How to use WAVE

Navigate to the [WAVE website][wave-website].

Paste the URL of the web page that you wish to evaluate, e.g. <https://bioconductor-website-next.vercel.app/>.

Carefully inspect the results and the advice.
In particular, the 'Details' tab can help process each issue separately.
Separately, the 'Styles' slide can help remove styles that otherwise obstruct the visibility of elements mentioned in the report.
