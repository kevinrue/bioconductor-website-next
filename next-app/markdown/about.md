# About Bioconductor

The mission of the Bioconductor project is to develop, support, and
disseminate free open source software that facilitates rigorous and
reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological
assays. We are dedicated to building a diverse, collaborative, and
welcoming community of developers and data scientists.

Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is
open source and open development. It has two releases each year, and
an active user community. Bioconductor is also available as Docker
images.
